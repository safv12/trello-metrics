## To get trello metrics follow next steps

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

    $ cd trello_metrics
    $ npm install

Edit /server/config/index.js with your trello token

 - To get your TRELLO_KEY visit: https://trello.com/app-key
 - To read a userâ€™s private information, get a token by directing them to https://trello.com/1/connect?key=[PUBLIC_KEY]&name=MyApp&response_type=token replacing, of course, <PUBLIC_KEY> with the public key obtained in the first step.

    trello: {
      key: '[TRELLO_KEY]',

    }
